Write a paragraph on how you balance your creativity and logic in you _passion projects_:

	1. I often find myself playing at home with my Arduino Atmega2650. I will set up lights to flash in conjunction with a song, or I
	will use a sonar sensor to determine distance. I feel this is using both halves of my brain becuase I have a goal in mind that I
	need to use my technical know-how to do, but there are also certain ways to go about it, and I am often creative with my
	solutions.
